                <p>Communication skills are important in multiple places, this is because the ability to communicate with one another is needed in daily lives. By delivering messages clearly, 
                    you will be able to understand other clearly and others can also work with you better. I have many experiences in building up effective communication skills, due to the past experiencces in teaching children in various ages, working
                    with colleagues in different age levels. This allowed me to build up effective communications with multiple group of people.

                <p>I have great skills in time management. As a student, having the ability to manage time effectively is important, as you have to balance school work and other activities, such as part-time jobes, social life, personal achievements, or on a more extend, hobbies.
                    Especially when attending universities, many things has to be balanced perfectly because this is the time that you could experience and learn many things about the world.

                <p>As a bilingual speaker, I have the ability to speak both chinese and english fluently. Due to the reason of studying abroad, I have been taking language tests such as ielts. Personally, I would not say 
                    that my Taiwanese is counted as an language skills, not only because the language is not available in many locations, but also I am not quite good at it. 
                    My family uses Taiwanese as second language, and some even as first, so I am pretty good at understanding it, but due to lack of practice in daily life, I would not say I am fluent in this language.
